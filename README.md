# LEAP

LEAP: Local Enumeration And Privesc.
As a first-year project, I created a script using my knowledge of Python 3 and Linux, that when chosen could
enumerate different operating systems and give a specific output depending on what was selected. This then chose
which possible privilege escalation methods were available to use and adopt the appropriate function that would
execute them.
